# adventureMe

## Inspiration
What if your next trip could lead you somewhere you never dreamed you'd end up, doing things you'd never imagined doing? When you plan a trip with a destination in mind, you're limited by the bounds of your own experience and, often, the places you've already travelled. The essence of this application is discovery: to learn we could explore a destination we might otherwise have never known about or considered. We wanted to know: given a certain budget, what might our next adventure look like?

## What Does adventureMe Do?
adventureMe takes a budget, vacation length, search start date, and takeoff point, and finds out just how far you can go. adventureMe calculates not only what deals exist today to make your dollar fly you further, but what events and attractions you can visit when you get there; adventureMe takes the "wishful" out of your thinking--this is about what you really can do with what you have.
